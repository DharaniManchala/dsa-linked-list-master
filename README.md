# 🔗 DSA Linked List Mastery – Structured Interview Preparation

This repository contains my daily practice of Linked List problems in Python, structured to build strong fundamentals for coding interviews at top tech companies like **Google, Amazon, and Microsoft**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To master the Linked List data structure from the ground up — covering everything from basic operations to advanced cycle and pointer-based problems — with clean code, edge case handling, and proper time and space complexity analysis.

---

## ✅ Problems Covered

- Insert at Beginning
- Insert at End
- Delete Node by Value
- Delete Node by Position
- Reverse Linked List (Iterative)
- Reverse Linked List (Recursive)
- Find Middle of Linked List
- Detect Cycle using Floyd’s Algorithm
- Safe Print with Cycle Detection
- Remove Loop from Linked List
- Check if Linked List is Palindrome
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List
- Find Intersection Point of Two Linked Lists
- Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists (Iterative & Recursive)
- Detect and Remove Loop (Combined)
- Sort a Linked List using Merge Sort
- Add Two Numbers (Linked List Digits) – 🏆 Google-Level
-Copy Linked List with Random Pointer (Meta/Google)
-  Flatten Multi-Level Doubly Linked List

---

## 🧠 How I Practice

- 💻 Write, test, and debug code manually in VS Code
- 🔍 Focus deeply on time and space complexity for each problem
- 🧪 Use test cases that reflect real interview logic
- 📘 Maintain clean, readable code with comments
- 🔁 Push to GitHub daily to track learning consistency

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

- Reinforces core DSA fundamentals required by top tech companies
- Builds strong confidence in pointer-based logic
- Improves whiteboard-style coding for interviews
- Helps track daily DSA growth and consistency
