# 🔗 DSA Linked List Mastery – Structured Interview Preparation

This repository contains my daily practice of Linked List problems in Python, structured to build strong fundamentals for coding interviews at top tech companies like **Google, Amazon, and Microsoft**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To master Linked List data structure from the ground up — covering everything from basic operations to advanced cycle and pointer-based problems — with clean code, edge case handling, and proper time and space complexity analysis.

## ✅ Topics Covered

| Step | Problem |
|------|------------------------------------------------|
| 01   | Insert at Beginning |
| 02   | Insert at End |
| 03   | Delete Node by Value |
| 04   | Delete Node by Position |
| 05   | Reverse Linked List (Iterative) |
| 06   | Reverse Linked List (Recursive) |
| 07   | Find Middle of Linked List |
| 08   | Detect Cycle using Floyd’s Algorithm |
| 09   | Safe Print with Cycle Detection |
| 10   | Remove Loop from Linked List |
| 11   | Check if Linked List is Palindrome |
| 12   | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List |
| 13   | Find Intersection Point of Two Linked Lists |
| 14   | Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists |
| 15   | Merge Two Sorted Lists (Recursive) |
| 16   | Detect and Remove Loop (Combined) |

> 🔄 Step 17 (Linked List Merge Sort) coming soon...

## 🧠 How I Practice

- 💻 Write, test, and debug code manually in VS Code
- 📚 Focus on time & space complexities
- 🧪 Use real interview logic and examples
- 🔁 Push to GitHub daily to track my consistency
